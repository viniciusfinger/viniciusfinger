# Hey you! 👋

I'm Vinícius Finger, a Brazilian Software Engineer passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Back-end development. Currently, I’m working with Generative AI, exploring how cutting-edge LLMs and AI agents can be applied to real-world problems.

I love building side projects to validate ideas, explore new technologies, and share what I learn with the community.
